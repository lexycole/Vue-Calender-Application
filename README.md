# ‚úçÔ∏è About 
The Vue.js Calendar Application is a web-based calendar application built using the Vue.js framework. It utilizes a store module to manage seed data for the calendar, including active day, events, and their respective details.
The application provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing events in the calendar. Users can submit new events, edit existing events, reset the edit mode for all events, update event details, and delete events. The store module includes methods to get and set the active day in the calendar, as well as retrieve event objects based on day ID and event details.
The application includes two main components: CalendarWeek and CalendarEntry. The CalendarWeek component is responsible for displaying the week view of the calendar, while the CalendarEntry component is likely used for adding or editing events in the calendar.
The application's user interface is designed to be responsive, with CSS styles utilizing flexbox for vertical alignment and centering of components. This ensures a consistent and optimal viewing experience across different screen sizes and devices.
